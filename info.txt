In sentiment analysis, polarity and subjectivity are two outputs that can be generated from a sentence. 
Polarity
Also known as orientation, polarity is the emotion expressed in a sentence. It can be positive, negative, or neutral. Polarity is a float value between [-1.0 to 1.0]. -1 indicates negative sentiment, 0 indicates neutral, and +1 indicates positive sentiment.
Subjectivity
Subjectivity is how opinionated or factual a text is. It refers to how subjective or objective a piece of text is. Subjectivity is a float value between [0.0 to 1.0]. 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.
